### Solar System
- Consists of a single star (the sun), numerous objects orbiting around the sun such as planets, dwarf/minor planets, asteroids, meteoroids, comets.
- Satellities (moons) orbit around planets.
- Closest concept to an isolated system. (no matter or energy is lost or gained.)
	- While planets are more closed systems.
- Origin of the Solar system was around 4,567,000,000 years ago or 4,567 million years ago.
	- Also written as 4567 Ma (Mega-annum) or 4.567 (Giga-annum).
- Central dense body became the sun, remaining dust and gas formed disks that condensed to form planets and other bodies.
- Astronomical unit is 150 million km (the average distance from Earth to the Sun)
### Gravity
- Gravitational force varies by distance, which is 1/d^2 (d being the distance from the sun)
- Eccentricity is how ellipitcal an orbit is compared to a perfect circle.
	- The lower the number, the closer it is to a perfect circle. 
- Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion
	- First Law: The shape of an orbnit is an ellipse.
	- Second Law: Equal areas are swept out in equal times.
		- Meaning that the further a planet is from the sun in orbit, the faster it is traveling in order to cover the same amount of area in the same time.
	- Third Law: Planets farther away form the Sun take much longer to complete their orbits. ![[Pasted image 20220921230555.png]]
### Bodies in Space
- Comets are highly elliptical orbits.
- Dwarf planets are larger than around 500km in diameter
	- Normally classified by brightness in the sky, but for class purposes we look at diameter.
- Asteroids are around 1 m to 500 km in diameter.
- Meteoroids are less than 1 m in diameter.
- Small bodies are composed of rock and metallic iron.
- Meteoroids that hit the ground are called meteorites.
- Terrestrial Planets are the inner planets consisting of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.
	- Mostly Iron core, mostly Silicon-Oxygen-Magnesium-Iron based mantle.
- Jovian Planets are the outer planets consisting of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
	- Hydrogen-rich atmosphere, liquid hydrogen interior, dense rock core. 
- Satellites orbit around planets.
### The Sun
- The sun is a star.
- Around 700 000 km in radius.
- Mass is around 10^30 kg.
- Uses nuclear fusion of hydrogen to make helium to create energy.
- c = fÎ»
	- Speed of light is equal to frequency * wavelength.
- Has a total of 3.8 * 10^26 W of energy.
- Energy flux (W/m^2) varies due to tilt of the Earth's axis.
- Solstices is when poles are tilted away from the Sun
- Equinoxes are when poles are parallel to orbit.
### Energy Cycle
- Energy inputs:
	- Light, radiant heat, thermal energy, tidal energy.
- Energy losses:
	- Reflection, re-radiation.
#### Solar Energy
- Energy from the Sun comes are EM radiation, mainly in the visible and infrared bands. (around 1.74 x 10 ^ 17 W)
- Energy is reflected, evaporates water, melting ice, heating the planet, photosynthesis.
#### Geotheremal Energy
- Volcanos, hot springs, submarine volcanoes, earthquakes.
