### Solar System
- Consists of a single star (the sun), numerous objects orbiting around the sun such as planets, dwarf/minor planets, asteroids, meteoroids, comets.
- Satellities (moons) orbit around planets.
- Closest concept to an isolated system. (no matter or energy is lost or gained.)
- Origin of the Solar system was around 4,567,000,000 years ago or 4,567 million years ago.
	- Also written as 4567 Ma (Mega-annum) or 4.567 (Giga-annum).
- Central dense body became the sun, remaining dust and gas formed disks that condensed to form planets and other bodies.
### Gravity
- Gravitational force varies by distance, which is 1/d^2 (d being the distance from the sun)
- Eccentricity is how ellipitcal an orbit is compared to a perfect circle.
	- The lower the number, the closer it is to a perfect circle. 
- Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion
	- First Law: The shape of an orbnit is an ellipse.
	- Second Law: Equal areas are swept out in equal times.
		- Meaning that the further a planet is from the sun in orbit, the faster it is traveling in order to cover the same amount of area in the same time.
	- Third Law: Planets farther away form the Sun take much longer to complete their orbits. ![[Pasted image 20220921230555.png]]
