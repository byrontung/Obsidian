## Notes
### Atmosphere
- Stores moisture, solar energy, and moves Earth's materials
- Troposphere is the lowest part of the atmosphere
	- Short-term changes (seconds to weeks) result in weather which is studied by meterologists
	- Long-term changes (months to billions of years) result in climate which is studied by climatologists.
	- Composed of nitrogen, oxygen, argon, water vapour.
		- Trace amounts of CO2, O3, CH4 but very important.
	- Aerosols: Water droplets, ice, dust, salt, carbon.

### Pressure and Temperature
- Temperature is the average kinetic energy of molecules.
	- More substance -> same temperature
- Heat is the total kinetic energy of all molecules in a substance.
	- More substance -> higher heat
- Air pressure increases as altitude decreases.
	- Mass of air above pushes molecules downwards, causing air pressure.
- Mercury and Aneroid barometers are used to measure pressure.
- Average pressure at sea level:
	- 101,325 Pascal (1 Pa = 1 N/m2 )
	- 101.325 kPa
	- 1.01325 bars
	- 1 atm
- Isobars is pressure that varies across the surface of the Earth.
	- Air goes from regions of high pressure to low pressure.
- Heat rises, but as altitude rises pressure drops.
	- From the lack of pressure, the gas cools.
	- Explains why tops of mountains are colder than valleys below.
### Structure of Atmosphere
- The atmosphere is split into the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere.
![[Pasted image 20220927114501.png]]
#### Mesosphere
- Temperature increases towards stratospause because of absorption of UV by ozone (O3)
#### Thermosphere
- Directly exposed to the Sun's radiation, therefore very high temperatures near the top.
- Low density means that total heat is low.
- Northern/southern lights are caused from stripped electrons from gas by solar wind and high-energy photons.
- Coldest point is at mesopause.
#### Stratosphere
- Heated from UV energy absorbed by ozone around stratopause.
#### Troposphere
- Heated from ernergy transfer of Earth's surface.
- Almost all weather comes from troposphere.
### Atmosphere Detailed Composition
#### Nitrogen
- Most abundant gas in atmosphere.
- Nitrogen cycle is used to convert nitrogen into a useable from.

#### Water Vapour
- Most variable component, 0.01% to 4%
- As temp increases, water vapour increaes as well.
#### Oxygen
- 2nd most abundant gas, vital for most life.
- Oxygen exists because of photosynthesis.
#### Ozone
- Present in trace amounts.
- Absorbs UV.
- Ozone layer is around 50 km above surface.
#### Argon 
- Full outer electron shell
- Few chemical interactions.
- Ex: Argon, helium, neon, krypton.
#### Carbon Dioxide CO2
- A greenhouse gas that is transpartent in visible light and UV.
- Absorbs IR, blocking heat that escapes.
#### Manthane CH4
- Main component of natural gas.
- Leaks during extraction by humans.
- Decay of vegetation and digestive process of animals.
- CH4 + O2 ->CO2 + H2O
- In low concentrations and short residence time as a greenhouse gas.
### Water in the Atmosphere
- On earth, water exists in all three phases.
- The phase depends on the temperture (C) and pressure (kPa) around the water's environment.
- Latent energy/heat is when energy is added or removed without changing its temperature.
	- TLDR: At a certain point, temperature that is added/removed will not be contributing to the temperature, but to break/form the bonds between molecules.
- Dalton's law of partial pressures -> Ptotal = Pnitrogen + Poxygen + Pwatervapour + ...
- If Ptotal = 101 kPa and air contains 1% water molecules, then partial pressure of water vapour is 1.01 kPa.
- Saturation of vapour pressure is when evaporation and condensation are equal.
- Relative humanity is when the ratio of actual vapour pressure/saturation vapour pressure.
	- To raise relative humidity, you can add more water vapour or lower the temperature.
		- Adding more water vapour increases vapour pressure, or lowering the temperature so that saturated vapour pressure will be lower.
- Dew point happens when oversaturation of relative humidity causing the vapour to condense to reduce vapour pressure in the air.
- Nucleation is when water droplets form clouds.
	- As size increases, so does collisions, which cause raindrop
