### Cyclones and Anticyclones in Northern hemisphere
- Cyclones are low-pressure system that has rising air and converging surface winds that spin inwards and counter-clockwise.
- Anticyclones are high-pressure system that descending air and diverging surface winds that spin out and clockwise.
- Direction of rotation are opposite if in the Southern hemisphere.

### Local Winds
- Sea breeze comes from daytime heated low-pressure air on land because of the sea's high heat capacity. 
	- This causes air to be cooled adiatically, which then sinks toward the sea as cool air. 
	- The high pressure of cool air then heads towards land because of the difference in pressure.
- Night time sea breeze is the opposite in direction.
	- Since the land cools faster than the sea, the hot air comes from the sea, which then rises, then cools due to adiabatic expansion, then sinks towards the land.
- Winds from cold mountain systems and glaciers cause lower ground to get winds called katabatic wind.
- Chinooks are when atmospheric flow force air over the mountains which warms adiabatically.
### Weather and Erosion by Wind
- Mud or dust is considered smaller than 1/16mm
	- Can be easily suspended by wind.
- Sand is between 1/16 mm to 2mm
	- Can be suspended with very high winds.
	- Normally moves on the surface with moderate winds.
- Gravel is larger than 2 mm.
	- Not usually moved by wind.
- Deposition happens when winds slow down.
- Wind-blown sediment are normally the same size and well rounded.
- For sand dunes, the upwards slant is called stoss slope while the steep downwards slope is called the lee face.
### Clouds and Fog
- Clouds are visible aersols consisting of water droplets and/or ice particles.
- Fog is a cloud that is on the surface of land or sea.
- Clouds and fog is formed when moist air is cooled below dew point.
- Density lifting happens when cool air around a cloud sink, which causes the cloud to grow vertically.
- Frontal lifting is from movement of air from warm air to cold.
- Orographic lifting is when clouds are forced to rise due to a geological structure such as a mountain.
- Convergence lifting is when air masses collide forcing the clouds to go upwards.
- Basic cloud types are: Cumulus, Cirrus, and Stratus.
#### Cirrus Clouds
- Wispy, high alitutude clouds.
- Typically ice particle clouds that form in the upper troposphere. (Above 6km)
#### Cumulus Clouds
- Flat based and domed tops. (also known as heaped shape)
- Cumulonimbus are cumulus clouds that climb to high altitudes, near tropopause.
	- Lightning is common with these clouds.
	- Can look anvil-shaped.
- Altocumulus form at moderate altitudes (2-6km)
	- Broader and less tall than cumulus clouds.
- Cirrocumulus form even higher, looks more whispy of ice clouds.
### Stratus clouds
- Form horizontally at low altitudes (<2km)
- Mainly composed of water droplets.
- Nimbostratus resembles stratus but produces rain or snow.
- Altostratus and cirrostratus are higher-a;titude variants of stratus.
- Stratocumulus are horizontally extensive clouds with domed/clumped features.
## Severe Weather
### Thunderstorms
- Forms from warm moist air when mT air contacts cP air.
- Lightning happens when strong air current causes ionization where the top of the cloud because positively charged and the base become negatively.
	- The balance of this separation of charges is lightning.
	- This can be cloud to cloud or cloud to ground discharge.
- Tornadoes are initiated with spiral updrafts which then funnel clouds until they touch the ground.
### Tropical Cyclones
- Form Â± 5 - 10 degrees from the equator, right outside of the ITCZ.
- They require warm moist air over the sea. (>26 degrees), condensation to supply latent heat for desnity lifting.
- Coriolis effect to drive rotation.
- When speeds are > 119km/hr, the cyclone reaches hurricane status.
- Hurricanes -> Atlantic, typhoons -> NW Pacific, cyclones -> Australia.
- Tropical cyclones can cause storm surge causing flooding.
	- Storm surges are when sea level raises up to 9m.
- ?Movement of ITCZ?
	- Migrates N and S during northern and southern winter.
	- Seasonal migration reverses wind direction.
