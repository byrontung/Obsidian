## Definitions

- Isolated Systems ; ystems that matter or energy is not lost and is an imagainary concept.
- Closed Systems ; systems that matter is not lost or gained, but energy can be exchanged.
	- Ex: Earth - Small amount of gas, material, etc are exchanged with outer space.
- Open Systems ;systems that exchange matter and energy with surroundings.
	- Ex: Atmosphere, ocean, island, forest, leaf, etc.
- Budget ; a cycle that is quantified.
- Reservior ; a location where quantity of material/energy sits.
- Flux ; the rate at which material moves from one reservoir to another.
- Water reservoirs in hydrologic cycle ; Ocean, Glaciers and ice, groundwater, surface water and atmosphereic water. (in order of largest to smallest.)
- Evapo-transpiration ; Water leaving land surface through plants via evaporation and transpiration.
- Residence time of water in a reservoir ; Average length of time a water molecule spends in a reservoir.

### Scientific Method
- Hypothesis with many tests is referred to as a law.
- Theory that passed even more tests can be trusted to be a law.
- Theories and laws can always change.
- Principles or working hypothesis is a hypothesis that works most of the time but has exceptions.
- Models are simplified versions of a complex system.
### Systems and Principals 
- Uniformitarianism is a principle that exaplins how Earth's catastrophes could be explained using rocks.
- Modern version of Uniformitarianism is Actualism.
- A system is a portion of the universe that can be seperated for the purpose of observing change.
	- Ex: Atmosphere, Hydrosphere, Biosphere, Geosphere, Solar System, etc.
